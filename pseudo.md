star wars RPG lul

think objects. everything in this game is an object. 

There are 4 playable characters. Each character has:
    health
    attack

There are 3 "states" for each character.
    choose
    enemy
    "defender" lul literally not an intuitive name
        this is who you are attacking at the moment.

in this game, everything is a click event
    click to choose a characer
    click to choose an enemy to attack
    click button to attack


The 4 characters are:
    Obi Wan
    Luke (WERE CHANGING THIS TO QUIGON JINN DAMMIT)
    Darth Sidious????
    Darth Maul lol y
        instead of a mix we're going to stick with episode 1

When you choose a character, the rest become enemies

the objects have to be represented in the html as well
