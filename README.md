This is a Star Wars themed RPG built using HTML, jQuery, and some CSS.

The player starts by choosing a character to fight with. The rest of the characters are made to be enemies. 
The player then chooses an enemy to attack. With every attack, the enemy health will decrease based on your starting attack power (10). The enemy will also counter attack and decrease the player's health. On each attack, the player's attack will increase by 10. This attack increase will last until the game restarts.

You can win with every character, you just have to choose the right enemy to start with.
